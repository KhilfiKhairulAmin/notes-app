# Node.js Note App
This is a Note App created in Node.js as a fun little project. This project utilizes the power of `chalk` and `yargs` to create a colourful command line interface (CLI) to create and read your notes. It feels a lot like Minecraft's command line with representative colours used in the text responses!
